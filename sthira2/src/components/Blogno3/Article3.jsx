      <section className="mb-12">
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          The mental health landscape has seen a significant transformation over the last few years, driven by advancements in technology. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and mental health apps, people now have access to more immediate and personalized support than ever before. In a world where mental health services are often inaccessible due to stigma or geographical barriers, technology offers a new avenue for care and well-being.

      <section className="mb-12">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">1. AI-Powered Chatbots</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          AI-powered chatbots, such as Woebot and Wysa, have revolutionized mental health care by providing users with real-time mental health support. These chatbots use natural language processing to simulate conversations with users, offering advice, exercises, and resources based on user inputs. They are available 24/7, ensuring that people have access to support whenever they need it.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
          Chatbots can help users manage stress, anxiety, and depression by guiding them through proven techniques such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). While these tools cannot replace professional therapy, they offer a starting point for individuals who may not yet be ready or able to seek formal treatment.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">2. Mental Health Apps</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          The explosion of mental health apps in recent years has made therapy and mental well-being resources more accessible. Apps like Calm, Headspace, and BetterHelp provide users with guided meditations, breathing exercises, therapy sessions, and mood tracking, all from the convenience of a smartphone.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
          These apps empower users to take control of their mental health on their own terms. Whether it’s practicing mindfulness, tracking mood swings, or accessing professional therapy via telehealth, mental health apps have become valuable tools in supporting mental well-being.

      {/* Section 3: Teletherapy and Remote Counseling */}
      <section className="mb-12">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">3. Teletherapy and Remote Counseling</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Another major advancement in mental health support is the rise of teletherapy and remote counseling services. Platforms like BetterHelp, Talkspace, and 1to1Help connect users with licensed therapists through video calls, chats, and phone sessions. This technology allows people in remote areas or those with busy schedules to access professional therapy without needing to travel.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
          Teletherapy has proven to be particularly beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing individuals to continue therapy while staying safe at home. It’s also a game-changer for people with mobility issues or those who feel anxious about visiting traditional therapy settings.

      <section className="mb-12">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">4. The Role of Wearable Technology</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Wearable devices, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, are also playing a significant role in mental health. These devices can monitor sleep patterns, heart rate, and stress levels, offering insights into a person’s mental and physical well-being. Apps integrated with wearables can provide users with personalized feedback and suggestions to help manage stress and anxiety more effectively.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
          For example, some wearables are equipped with guided breathing exercises that users can engage in when their stress levels are detected to be high. This kind of real-time feedback is invaluable for users looking to manage their mental health proactively.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">5. Limitations and Challenges</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          While technology is revolutionizing mental health support, it does have its limitations. AI-powered tools and mental health apps can’t fully replace the human touch that traditional therapy offers. Additionally, concerns around data privacy and the accuracy of AI-driven insights remain important issues.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
          However, these tools can complement traditional therapy, providing immediate support when professionals are unavailable and helping bridge gaps in access to care.
